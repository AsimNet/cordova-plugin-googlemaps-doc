# For Ionic 2 users

Thank you for using the cordova-googlemaps-plugin.

The cordova-googlemaps-plugin v2-beta is in public beta; performance has been improved.
The most of cases are no problem.

Unfortunately, Masashi(@wf9a5m75) is not familiar with the Ionic framework, so basically there is no support for the [ionic-native-googlemaps](http://market.ionic.io/starters/google-maps) plugin itself.
(But you can still question or report your issue to the issue list.)

## The ionic-native wrapper plugin

The ionic team creates a wrapper plugin of this plugin in order to use this plugin with typescript.
You can read documents at https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/google-maps/
